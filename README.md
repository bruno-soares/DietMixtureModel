# Diet Mixture Model: Estimation Procedure for Maximum Likelihood Estimates of Prey Contributions to Predator Diets

####Pamela Moriarty, Tim Essington and Eric Ward

##Purpose:
####This is an online supplement for:
 Moriarty, P.E., T.E. Essington, E.J. Ward. 2016. A Novel Method to Estimate Prey Contributions to Predator Diets. Canadian Journal of Fishery and Aquatic Sciences. In review. 

This document demonstrates an example of the mixture model described in the above article. In this supplement, we provide a simulated dataset and an actual dataset used in the article above. We use the provided R code to run our mixture model in order to estimate the model parameters for the datasets. Code was built and tested under R version 3.1.0.
